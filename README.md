# The official Docker image for Gel

This repository contains the officially maintained Docker image packaging
Gel and the Gel CLI.

#### ✨[Documentation](https://docs.geldata.com/resources/guides/deployment/docker)✨

## When to use this image

This image is intended for use in production, or as part of a
development setup that involves multiple containers orchestrated by
Docker Compose or a similar tool. Otherwise, we recommend using the [`edgedb CLI`](https://docs.geldata.com/learn/cli) to install Gel and
manage local instances.

## What is Gel?

built on top of PostgreSQL, featuring:

- strict, object-oriented typed schema;
- powerful and expressive query language;
- rich standard library;
- built-in support for schema migrations;
